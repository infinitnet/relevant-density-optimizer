Optimize your content's SEO by highlighting important terms and analyzing their density in your WordPress posts and pages.

== Description ==

Relevant Density Optimizer (RDO) is a powerful SEO tool that helps you optimize the density of important keywords and phrases in your content. By analyzing and highlighting term usage directly in the Gutenberg editor, RDO provides real-time insights to improve your on-page SEO.

= Key Features =

* **Term Highlighting**: Visually identify where your important terms appear in your content
* **Density Analysis**: Get real-time calculations of your terms' density in both overall content and headings
* **Term Organization**: Sort terms alphabetically or by frequency of use
* **Filtering Options**: Filter to see only unused terms to identify optimization opportunities
* **Search Functionality**: Quickly find specific terms in your list
* **One-Click Copy**: Easily copy terms to paste elsewhere in your content

= Why Relevant Term Density Matters =

Relevant term density is an important aspect of on-page SEO. Too few mentions of key terms may result in poor rankings and indicate "fluff" which reduces overall text relevance.

= How It Works =

1. Add your important terms in the RDO sidebar
2. Toggle highlighting to see where terms appear in your content
3. Review term density statistics for your overall content and headings
4. Optimize your content based on the insights provided
5. Save your terms for future editing sessions

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `relevant-density-optimizer` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Open any post or page in the Gutenberg editor
4. Click the "Relevant Density Optimizer" icon in the top-right editor toolbar
5. Enter your important terms and start optimizing!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where do I find the RDO panel in the editor? =

After activating the plugin, open any post or page in the Gutenberg editor. Click on the "Relevant Density Optimizer" icon in the top-right toolbar (it looks like a line chart).

= How do I add terms to track? =

In the RDO sidebar, enter your terms in the "Relevant Terms" text area. You can separate terms using commas or by placing each term on a new line.

= What is the ideal keyword density? =

There's no universal ideal density, but generally, your content should be as relevant as possible.

= Can I save my terms for future editing? =

Yes! Click the "Update Terms" button to save your terms. They will be available the next time you edit the post or page.

= Does this plugin slow down my editor? =

RDO is designed to be lightweight and efficient. The term highlighting feature uses debounced functions to ensure minimal impact on editor performance.
